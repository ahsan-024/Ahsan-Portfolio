# Ascendexits - Private Equity Web Portal

## Overview

Project Overview

A full-stack Laravel 11 web application built for a private equity firm, featuring a modern public-facing website and a secure admin panel to manage acquisitions, partners, team members, and contact enquiries. The system leverages Eloquent ORM, RESTful routes, and Laravel Breeze authentication to provide robust CRUD-based content management, along with a responsive UI using Bootstrap 5 and integrated email notifications for contact form submissions.

## Key Features

- Public-facing marketing site with home, acquisitions, partners, team, and contact pages. 
- Admin panel for managing acquisitions, partners, team members, and contact enquiries via CRUD interfaces.
- File upload support for company logos and team images with storage integration.
- Contact form with server-side validation, email confirmations, and admin notifications.
- Role-based access via authentication and email verification for admin users.
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap so the site works well on desktop and mobile.


## Technologies Used

- Laravel 11 / PHP – Backend logic, routing, and MVC architecture.
- MySQL (via Eloquent ORM) – Data storage for acquisitions, partners, team members, and contacts.
- Blade / Bootstrap – Public and admin UI templates with responsive layout.
- JavaScript / AJAX – Interactive filters, charts, and live updates
- JavaScript / Alpine.js – Lightweight interactivity in views.
- Laravel Mail – Transactional emails for contact confirmation and notifications.


## My Role and Process

- Designed the data model and database migrations for acquisitions, partners, teams, and contacts.
- Implemented CRUD flows and validation for admin management of content, including file uploads and sorting.
- Built public pages that consume Eloquent query scopes (active, ordered) to show curated content.
- Integrated email workflows for contact form submissions (user confirmation and admin alert).


## Outcomes

- Delivered a production-ready site where non-technical admins can manage all public content without code changes.
- Improved contact handling by centralizing enquiries in the database with read/unread status and email alerts.
- Created a consistent, responsive UI that aligns with the brand and works reliably across devices.


## Reflections

Working on this project deepened my experience with Laravel 11, particularly around Eloquent query scopes, resource controllers, and form validation. It reinforced best practices for structuring admin vs. public areas, handling file uploads securely, and designing simple, data-driven dashboards that make content and enquiry management straightforward for business users.
