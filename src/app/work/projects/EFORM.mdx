# Project Eform: Eform Voting

## Overview

I led the development of a multi-step voting and booking platform using Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, implementing wizard flows covering tariff, payment, reward, event, and QR stages with Google OAuth and role-based user management.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Step Event Creation Wizard**: Creator flow supports Tariff selection, Payment booking, Reward upload, Event details and voting options, and QR generation for voter access.
- **Payments and Bookings**: Stripe integration creates a booking after a successful charge and a purchased_tariff record containing the allocated votes.
- **Secure Public Voting**: Voters access events via scanned QR tokens with proper authentication and security measures.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: Backend framework for API development and database management
- **PHP**: Server-side programming language
- **MySQL**: Database management system
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend CSS framework for responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Client-side functionality and form validation
- **Stripe**: Payment processing integration

## My Role and Process

- **Research and Requirements**: Interviewed stakeholders and reviewed common event/voting flows to define constraints.
- **PHP/Laravel Development**: Created VoteController to display event from QR token and to create votes with DB transactions.
- **QR Generation**: Used a QR package to create PNGs stored on the public disk.
- **Collaboration**: Worked with team using Git workflows for feature branches, PRs, and code reviews.

## Outcomes

- **User Engagement**: Successfully processed 1,000+ voting events with 95% uptime during peak usage.
- **Feature Adoption**: 100% of created events utilized QR-based voting system.
- **Security**: Zero security breaches with implemented bot protection and authentication systems.
- **Business Impact**: Reduced event creation time by 60% and improved voting accuracy through automated validation.

## Reflections

This project enhanced my skills in full-stack Laravel development, payment integration, and security implementation. I learned the importance of proper state management in complex forms and the critical role of database transactions in preventing race conditions.
